# Hermes-Twitter
A Twitter bot (@OmegaTarot) for scheduled posting of random images and text logs.

## About
This program was made with the intention of practicing the navigation of system files to manipulate random images and pieces of text, as well as to post to Twitter at least once a day.

### Features
Currently, it draws a random tarot card, finds the card's matching image and text log, and posts the created tweet

Planned is the ability to respond to direct messages using the integrated tarot deck generator to mimic an earlier project, this time giving tarot readings on demand through messages.
